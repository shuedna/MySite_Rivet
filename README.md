# MySite_Rivet
My Site Code Using Rivet 

This is Is the first site I made using Rivet and TCL as my server side scripting. 
I appologize for the lack of notes and improper code but it is mostly functional. 

The blog links and descriptions are generated by comments in the top two lines of items in the cnt_blogs folder.

The Divs on the main page are generated from the cnt_home_div folder. 

Login script uses a sqlite DB for usernames and passwords. a unique hash is created apon login and saved in the database.
The unique has is saved in a cookie. after login each link then checks to make sure the cookie hash matches the key befor proceeding.
it also makes sure the timeout duration has not been reach since the last check if matches the time is updated and the new next page is generated.

New users can be added to the database. I have yet to implement any other user management. (the database uploaded has been scrubed of usersnames and passwords.) 

New content can be writen to the cnt_blogs & cnt_home_div folder via TinyMCE editor ( the script for TinyMCE has not been included). 

All of this was working well on the site www.shueit.net untill recently after a server reboot the database is now thowing a error that is readonly when login script is run.
